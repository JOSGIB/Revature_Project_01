# Revature Project One | Bug Catcher

> Outline: create test cases and reports based on the findings of a web application, Bug Catcher

### Project Overview
Tools used were `Maven`, `Selenium`, `Cucumber`, `TestNG`, `Gherkin`
```
 Using the tools listed above I was able to create and define test cases for web application
 pre-defined feature files. The web application, Bug Catcher, is a test case and bug-reporting
 management system. As well, with information gained throughout the project, I was able to 
 create Requirement Traceability Matrixs (RTM), Test Case Documents, and Defect Report Documents.
```
